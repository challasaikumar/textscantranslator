üîß Project Prompt: Build a Full-Stack Text Scan Translator Website
Objective:
Create a web-based application where users can upload an image (with text) or a text file. The app will:

Extract text from the uploaded file using OCR (if image).

Translate the extracted text into one or more Indian regional languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.).

Summarize the translated (or original) text.

Store the original, translated, and summarized text into a cloud database.

Display results on the frontend.

Be deployable and production-ready.

‚úÖ Core Features
User Upload Interface

Accept image files (JPEG/PNG) or text files (.txt, .docx, PDF).

Validate and preview files before processing.

Text Extraction

Use Tesseract OCR or Google Vision API for extracting text from images.

Use appropriate libraries for text file parsing (like python-docx, PyMuPDF, or plain file I/O).

Translation

Use Google Translate API, IndicTrans, or AI4Bharat APIs for translating to Indian languages such as:

Hindi

Bengali

Tamil

Telugu

Marathi

Kannada

Gujarati

Summarization

Use an NLP library or API such as HuggingFace Transformers (e.g., bart-large-cnn or t5) or OpenAI GPT API to summarize the extracted or translated text.

Cloud Database Integration

Store:

User file metadata

Original text

Translated text (per language)

Summary

Use Firebase Firestore, MongoDB Atlas, or Google Cloud Firestore.

Frontend (UI/UX)

Built with React, Vue, or Next.js.

Sections for:

File upload

Processing status
